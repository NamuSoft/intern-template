[Code Convention Docs Link](https://coal-blouse-907.notion.site/Namulabs-Coding-Convention-783f33a9ec5748d494c0841bf8226c67?pvs=4)

- Work while maintaining the code conventions as much as possible.
- If you cannot adhere to the conventions, you must explain the reason through comments.
  - This is to reduce confusion among other collaborators.

## Git Branch Strategy

- Create a sub-branch from the main branch for each page you are developing.
- Once the page development is complete, create a Pull Request to request a review.
- When creating a PR, always pull the latest content from the main branch to avoid conflicts with the main branch.
